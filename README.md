# VeloMeter
Spot speed bicycle survey Arduino-based technology. 

It uses two infrared sesnors installed at 30cm distance to log bicycle times via Arduino onto a microSD card.
Then data are post-processed in R.
Arduino code is largely based on .ino file in stengattini/BCDT.

Method is not validated. But is has been used in a spot survey in Vancouver (CANADA) and seems to provide reasonable results.
